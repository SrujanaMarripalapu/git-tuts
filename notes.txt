version control - a system that keeps records of your changes.
- allows for collaborative development
- allows to know who made what changes & when
-allows to revert any changes

types of vc system 

1.local - works only on local system ie., in laptop always point to latest update (works only if u r the developer and dont want to collebrate with team)

2. centralized - colleberates and developers will communicate with main server repository and write the code.

there wont be any local copy of code or project .

3.distributed - mostly and widely used, bcoz it has both main server and 
local repository.

pull - taking the code in local repository
push - pushing the code into the main server

--> for version changes, track the changes and
--> to save the project 

	we use git vcs


GIT - is a vcs (version control system)
GITHUB - one example of remote repository hosting(to store) service

1.repository - a folder for project
remote repository - to store remote repositories github is an example

2.local respository - repository present in local system

3. staging area- we can how many files we want wwe can send those files only using staging area
.
4.working directory - stage we are working is the working directory , untracked section is the working directoey

after saving the files in the local repository only we can save them in remote repository
